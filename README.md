📌 Project Overview

Manufacturing processes are often hindered by unpredictable output, inconsistent quality, and operational inefficiencies. This project tackles these challenges by analyzing historical and simulated sensor data, including:

Temperature

Humidity

Machine speed

Material type


Key objectives include:

Yield prediction using a Random Forest Regressor

Data visualization through 10+ insightful plots

Feature importance analysis to uncover performance drivers

Real-time analytics using embedded datasets (no external files)


The final system is modular, interpretable, and ready for integration into smart factory environments.
