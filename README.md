Production Yield Analysis

A Data-Driven ML System for Predicting & Optimizing Manufacturing Yield
Using Python, Visualizations, and IoT Integration


---

📌 Project Overview

Manufacturing environments often struggle with unpredictable output, process inefficiencies, and inconsistent product quality. This project introduces a machine learning–powered production analytics system that leverages real-time and historical industrial sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, machine speed, material type) to:

Predict production yield using machine learning models

Visualize operational trends and relationships with advanced plotting

Identify performance drivers via correlation and feature importance

Enable real-time insights with embedded sample data (no external files needed)


The system is modular, interpretable, and designed for seamless integration into smart factory ecosystems.
